# Cloud Training

This guide covers how to train models on remote clusters using Oumi's command-line interface. This includes popular cloud providers (GCP, Azure, AWS, etc.), or your own custom clusters which you can integrate with Oumi. Oumi's unified configs make it seamless to migrate from local to cloud training, or from one cloud provider to another.
